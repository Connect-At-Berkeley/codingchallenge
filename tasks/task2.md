# Task 2: Spice Up Your Image Uploader Website [OPTIONAL]

## Steps
Try to spice up your website with some cool CSS!

You can start by uncommenting the lines of code in `index.html` to load your CSS file. 

Then, you can start coding in the `css/styles.css` file and add your own style to it. We've added some examples to spark your creativity!

Also, feel free to add additional HTML elements for each image that you think would make the website more user friendly. For example, you could add the title, upload date, etc. to the right of each image uploaded. You could even go a step further and present each image in a tabular format or as a carousel (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp).
